Liquid demo
===========

This is a demonstration app, showing Toga used to build a standalone
desktop application that is just a wrapper around a web page. It wraps
GitHub, but it's a one line source modification to make it wrap any
other webpage. It should be fairly obvious from the source code which
line needs to be modified.

Usage
-----

Briefcase can be used to wrap this as a standalone app under macOS::

    $ mkdir liquid
    $ cd liquid
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate.bash  # Adjust accordingly for you shell.
    $ python -m pip install briefcase
    $ git clone https://github.com/pybee/liquid-demo.git
    $ cd liquid-demo
    $ python setup.py macos

This will create a macOS directory that will contain "GitHub.app".
This app file can be placed in your Applications folder. It can also be sent
to another user safe in the knowledge that it will also run on their machine -
the application is entirely self-contained.

Modificatons
------------

Once you've got the basics working, you can make modifications. You could:

* Turn this project into a cookiecutter template

* Add menu items or a toolbar to access common URLs

* Add a custom icon
